            Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the
            bad,
            having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book
            scrapes
            away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and
            maintainable
            than the language as a whole-a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code.
            Considered
            the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies
            the
            abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas
            such
            as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately,
            these
            good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global
            variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its
            popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The
            Good
            Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a
            detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including:
